Please review the template in 'plugins/_template/src' (see below for file content) and 'plugins/_template/LLM.txt' (see below for file content) 

I want to restructure 'plugins/telegram/src' (see below for file content) so it follows this same, index contract service flow

And then read the 'plugins/_template/LLM.txt' (see below for file content) and make sure to update the 'plugins/telegram/README.md' (see below for file content) 

Please scope it out and fix
