I've installed and run this app, when i closed the app i noticed there was a small blank window open to the upper left titled "tk" this shouldnt be happening. I'd also like some indication to drage the app to the applications folder during the install process, it wasnt immediatly apparent what to do, please resolve keeping in mind maintaining a cohesive macos visual is important, and rebuild for v1.2.1
